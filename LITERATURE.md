# Documentation and interesting papers on online distributional prediction 

**Probabilistic Forecasting** is particularly valuable in supply chain management. Below are some interesting resources for a deeper understanding:  

- [Probabilistic Forecasting](https://www.lokad.com/probabilistic-forecasting-definition/) – Overview of probabilistic forecasting and its applications.  
- [Quantile Forecasting](https://www.lokad.com/quantile-regression-time-series-definition/) – Explanation of quantile-based forecasting methods.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - [Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)](https://www.lokad.com/continuous-ranked-probability-score/)  
  - [Cross-Entropy](https://www.lokad.com/cross-entropy-definition/)  
  - [Pinball Loss](https://www.lokad.com/pinball-loss-function-definition/)



Papers:
- [NGBoost: Natural Gradient Boosting for Probabilistic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.03225) is a method for probabilistic regression that extends gradient boosting to predict full probability distributions instead of just point estimates.
- [Quantile Regression](http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/research/rq/QRJEP.pdf) models the conditional quantiles of a target variable instead of just the mean.
